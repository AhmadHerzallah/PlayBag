## What is PlayBag?
A Mobile-Application for Gamers, Investors, and Companies for eSports tournaments in-general

## User Groups

### Gamers

as gamers, we want to invest our time by participating in tournaments to win prizes either money or swags.
issue: thereâ€™s no one platform where most of the tournaments are, including a tab to view stats (tournaments, rankings).

### Investors

as investors, we'd sponsor tournaments to share our brand with the world and to support gamers who are playing the tournaments
issue: no platform to invest into well-known tournaments

### Companies

as companies who are interested in esports communities, having one platform where we can post our announcements and participate form for tournaments that we'll run on our own.
issue: want a platform where we can advertise our tournament
